## 📝 Notes

### Important Points:

1. **Password Security**: All demo passwords are simple for testing. In production, enforce strong password policies.

2. **Data Filtering**:

   - FLEET_DRIVER role sees ONLY assigned vehicle data (strict filtering)

3. **Assigned Vehicles**:
   - `driver` → V000001
   - `driver_user` → V000002
   - `fleet_driver` → V000003

4. **Role Switching**: To test different roles, logout and login with different credentials.

5. **Browser Storage**: Login state is stored in localStorage. Clear browser data to reset.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: "Invalid username" error
- **Solution**: Ensure username is typed correctly (case-insensitive)

**Issue**: "Invalid password" error
- **Solution**: Check password matches exactly (case-sensitive)

**Issue**: Menu items not showing
- **Solution**: Role-based access is working correctly. Some features are restricted by role.

**Issue**: Cannot see all vehicles
- **Solution**: FLEET_DRIVER role is designed to see only assigned vehicles. This is expected behavior.

**Issue**: Cannot add vehicles
- **Solution**: FLEET_DRIVER role doesn't have permission to add vehicles. Use SALES or DEALER role instead.
